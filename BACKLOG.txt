DOING
------
- on branch authentication: use an Authentication object to authenticate a user and don't store current user in VirtualUsersManager
    - on branch passwd: users must be stored in the filesystem in /etc/passwd

NEXT
-----
- generalize InMemoryFS and make an UnixLikeInMemoryFS:
    - InMemoryFS:
      - don't create a VirtualUsersManager and VirtualSecurityManager inside (pass two functions to the constructor?)
    - I don't like VirtualFS constants for root, pathSeparator and so on, probably is better to have them as properties in
      VirtualFS, but it's not easy, probably I must set the FS in every folder / file
- VirtualUsersManagerFileImpl:
  - refactor passing the path of the password file
  - now the content of passwd is a Map, so it is not serialized in scalajs-console-game, its good I think, but would it be better
    to mark it as non serializable (a tag trait NonSerializableContent? )
- VirtualUsersManager.addUser must return Either[IOError, VirtualFolder] where the folder is the home folder of the user
- VirtualNode chown, chgrp
- sbt: tests on publish

DONE
-----
- VirtualPath.toParentFolder
- more robust VirtualPath.andThen(String)
- VirtualPath.andThen(PathFragment)
- VirtualPath.andThen(VirtualPath)
