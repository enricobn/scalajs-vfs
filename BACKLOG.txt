- I don' like VirtualPath to depend on VirtualFS constants, I think that there should not be methods that rely on those constants
  it would be better to use always fragments, so VirtualPath.apply should be like .of
- ~ is resolved by the shell, all the actual VirtualFS constants should be resolved by the shell?
- methods resolve* in VirtualFolder are like find* in VirtualShell and resolveOrError in VirtualFolder are like to* in VirtualShell!!!
- VirtualUsersManager.addUser must return Either[IOError, VirtualFolder] where the folder is the home folder of the user
- dates in files
- size in files (is it possible?)
- generalize InMemoryFS and make an UnixLikeInMemoryFS (there is one UnixLikeInMemoryFS in scalajs-shell!!!):
    - InMemoryFS:
      - don't create a VirtualUsersManager and VirtualSecurityManager inside (pass two functions to the constructor?)
    - I don't like VirtualFS constants for root, pathSeparator and so on, probably is better to have them as properties in
      VirtualFS, but it's not easy, probably I must set the FS in every folder / file
- VirtualUsersManagerFileImpl:
  - refactor passing the path of the password file
  - now the content of passwd is a Map, so it is not serialized in scalajs-console-game, its good I think, but it would be better
    to mark it as non serializable: mark the file, since for the same content some file should be serialized and not another.
- VirtualNode chown, chgrp

- VirtualPath.toParentFolder
- more robust VirtualPath.andThen(String)
- VirtualPath.andThen(PathFragment)
- VirtualPath.andThen(VirtualPath)
